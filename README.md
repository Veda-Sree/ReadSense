Problem Statement:
Design and develop an application that categorizes book summaries into genres. The application should classify summaries into one or more genres and enhance the user experience with features like keyword highlighting, personalized book recommendations, and external API integration for enriched metadata. The goal is to make book categorization seamless, insightful, and user-friendly, catering to readers, writers, and researchers.

Features of the Enhanced Application
1. Genre Classification with Multi-Genre Support

Classify book summaries into one or more genres based on their content.
Handle overlapping genres, e.g., classify a summary into both Sci-fi and Romance if applicable.
2. Keyword Highlighting

Highlight keywords or phrases from the summary that are most influential in determining the genre.
Use NLP techniques like TF-IDF or attention weights to identify relevant terms.
3. Book Recommendations

Suggest books in similar genres based on the analyzed summary.
Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to generate recommendations.
4. API Integration

Fetch metadata (e.g., author, publication year, reviews) from external APIs like Goodreads or Google Books.
Use this data to provide richer insights about the book and its categorization.
